# Charity_Decentralized
# Introduction
A charity is an organization which is set up to provide help and raise money for people in need. People in need include the beggars, orphanages, natural disaster victims and several others. However, there are many fake charity organizations that claim to be genuine. Such organizations loot money from innocent persons in the name of charity work. Several people donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are not certain if the money is going to reach the right hands of those in
need. In this context, the transparency of charity organizations are questioned and this leads to several challenges.
Some of the challenges that are commonly faced in the charity organizations are:
 1. Looting of funds
 2. Lack of communication
 3. Failure in monitoring the flow of funds
 4. Manipulation of charity projects
# Objectives / Significance
This project aims to design a decentralized charity fund optimization (CFO) system based on the blockchain technology so as to trace the management of charity funds from the donors or contributors to the needy. It ensures that donated money reaches needy people. In this project, the needy people will upload their details on the portal linked to the blockchain system, the donors accesses charity organizations’ and needys’ data from the Blockchain and assist the needy people directly. Implementing such blockchain technology projects assists needy people and ensures transparency in charity transactions.
The objectives of this project will result to the following:
 1. Platform to trace donors funds
 2. Proper fund management
 3. Restriction of looting
 4. Monitoring charity projects
 5. Transparent communication and data supply
# Layout of the system
The system architecture consists of three layers:
 1. Application Layer (Target Audience)
 2. Blockchain Layer
 3. Infrastructure Layer
The application layer consists of the donors, the charity organizations and the needy
The blockchain layer consists of the reputation system and smart contract.
The infrastructure layer will include the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and nodes.
# Programming Language
The smart contract that will run this system will be designed with solidity language on the Polygon network, and deployed using Hardhat, and Alchemy will serve as a Node provider for remote procedure call (RPC) to communicate with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The frontend of my application will be built with React and communication to the blockchain will be done using Ethers.js.
